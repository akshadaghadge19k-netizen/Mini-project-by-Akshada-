## Algorithm
- Step 1: Start the program.
- Step 2: Initialize the head pointer of the Linked List as NULL (indicating an empty playlist).
- Step 3: Display the playlist menu options to the user (Insert, Delete, Search, Display, Exit).
- Step 4: Ask the user to enter their choice.
- Step 5: If choice is 1 (Insert Song):
   Input the song name from the user.
   Allocate memory for a new node.
   Store the song name in the node and point its next pointer to the current head.
   Update head to point to this new node.
- Step 6: If choice is 2 (Delete Song):
  - Check if the playlist is empty (head == NULL). If yes, display "Playlist is empty."
	- Otherwise, store the current head in a temporary pointer, move head to head->next, and delete the temporary node.
- Step 7: If choice is 3 (Search Song):
  - Input the song name to be searched.
	- Start traversal from the head node.
	- Compare the target name with each node's song name. If found, display "Song found in playlist."
	- If the end of the list is reached and the song is not found, display "Song not found."
- Step 8: If choice is 4 (Display Playlist):
  - Check if the playlist is empty.
	- If not empty, traverse through all nodes from head to NULL and print the song name stored in each node.
- Step 9: If choice is 5 (Exit):
  - Display "Exiting..." and terminate the loop.
- Step 10: Repeat Steps 3-9 using a do-while loop until the user chooses option 5.
- Step 11: Stop the program.
